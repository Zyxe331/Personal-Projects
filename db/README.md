# Database Script Storage
This directory is just for storing the database definition and any insert statements that are being used for development.
If you are creating a new script to store in here, please provide some information about what it is, and why it's being included in the project.

Existing Scripts(WIP):
 - Vet-Database-Script.sql: This script defines the database without any data
 - dump.sql: this script restores the db and it's data from a previous dump.
 - server_vets_database.sql: This script defines the database creation for the server.
 - testInserts/*.sql: insert statements to provide test data.
