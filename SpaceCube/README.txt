CONTROLS:
Arrow Keys - Move Left or Right
Space Bar - Boost Current Speed Level


This is the first full game I have ever created. It is lacking in a lot of areas, such as no music, only 3 levels, and no true ending. However, that was never the intention for this project. I had bigger and better plans in mind, and I really only wanted a playable game that would teach me how to use the Godot Engine.

I decided early on that I wanted it to be a platformer with some gimmick that implements some gimmick on the physics engine. I settled on the idea of having to mash the space bar to increase your speed.

As a technical completion, I am very proud of this game. I created every asset in the game from the sprites (except for one specific easter egg) to the level design. It has a fully working movement engine and a clever concept that has a good visual feedback. However, as a game I find this very lacking. It's greatest crime is that it misses the fun. While mashing the space bar for more speed is a cool concept, I think it quickly becomes more aggravating than fun. Furthermore, I ran into some major glitches at the end of the game, but since I wanted to move on I left the game with no clear end win screen.
